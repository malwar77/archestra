/**
 * The client-side decoration prefixes that belong to one of our gateways,
 * learned from the caller's own declared tool list.
 *
 * The anchor the loop above uses — matching the label against a gateway name
 * the organization knows — assumes the client registered the gateway under the
 * name the connection-setup script derives. Nothing enforces that: the label is
 * whatever the person who ran `claude mcp add <label> <url>` typed, so it is
 * routinely something else entirely, and then no label matches at any index and
 * every decorated name survives untouched. Guardrails downstream reason about
 * the decoration instead of the tool, and policy lookups miss the row that
 * speaks for it.
 *
 * A client namespaces every tool from ONE server with the SAME prefix, so the
 * prefix is identifiable from evidence rather than convention: whichever prefix
 * a request's tool list carries in front of one of *our* branded tool names is
 * that request's decoration for our gateway. That is per-request, and it names
 * a prefix rather than trusting a name — a server can only ever claim its own
 * prefix, never another server's.
 *
 * Which bounds the spoof this anchoring exists to prevent. A hostile MCP server
 * connected straight to the client can put our branded name on its own tools
 * and so claim its own prefix — but claiming it only causes ITS names to be
 * stripped to `<server>__<tool>`, which is then looked up and policy-evaluated
 * like any other tool. That is strictly more enforcement than the untouched
 * name it gets today, which matches no row and is evaluated by nothing. The one
 * thing it must not buy is built-in status, since built-ins bypass policy — so
 * {@link stripLearnedDecoration} refuses to hand back a branded name. Built-in
 * recognition keeps requiring the strict, unlearned anchor above.
